# Phishing_email_detector
A simple Python script that scans email text for common phishing keywords and alerts users to potential scams.

This beginner-friendly Python project helps detect possible phishing attempts by analyzing email text for suspicious words and phrases.
The script reads user-input email content, converts it to lowercase, and checks for known phishing indicators like “urgent,” “verify,” “login,” “bank,” and “click here.”

It demonstrates core Python skills such as string handling, loops, and conditional logic, while introducing practical cybersecurity awareness about social engineering and phishing detection.
